## Induction

When you first join the lab (ideally within the first few weeks), you will have
a meeting with Leo to introduce lab protocols, set expectations, add you to
communication channels, etc.

For a preview of the things we will do before, during, and after the meeting,
take a look at the
[induction checklist](https://github.com/compgeolab/manual/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/induction.md).

## Expectations

We intend to foster a collegial lab atmosphere, with opportunities for
spontaneous discussions and creative opportunities.

* Lab members are **not** expected to sacrifice personal or leisure time in
  service of projects.
* Working long hours without interruption can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and
  overall **impedes** the type of atmosphere we are trying to develop.

Lab members should endeavor to be good University of Liverpool "citizens",
including:

* Participating in seminars and all-hands meetings.
* Contributing to department projects.
* Collaborating with individuals from other groups around campus.
* Fostering new collaborations both internal and external.

We strive to be a part of the intellectual community at the University of
Liverpool.

> **Note:** Human resources guidelines and the
[PGR Code of Practice](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/aqsd/academic-codes-of-practice/pgr-code-of-practice/)
> take precedence over this section.

## Communication

**If you wish to contact the group, please email
[Leo](https://www.compgeolab.org/team/) directly.**

How we communicate within the lab:

* **Slack:** Our [Slack team](https://compgeolab.slack.com) is the primary mode
  of communication for quick messages, announcements, reminders, and organizing
  meetings.
  Messages are ephemeral so you cannot count of being able to read messages
  older than 6 months! **Use email if you need a record of the conversation.**
* **GitHub:** Each project is assigned a repository on our
  [GitHub account](https://github.com/compgeolab/).
  Reviews of code, text, etc., will be done through the repository. We'll also
  use to set goals and tasks.
* **Group meetings:** We will have *short* monthly group meetings for quick
  updates from everyone, general discussion, announcements, interesting papers,
  and informal chat.
* **Individual meetings:** We aim to have weekly individual meetings to discuss
  project status, goals, and work through problems and ideas.
* Group members are also encouraged to have meetings and messages with each
  other. **Don't wait until problems build up to seek guidance.**

Using our website:

* Source code used to generate the website:
  [compgeolab/website](https://github.com/compgeolab/website).
* Members are expected to post **short** news items when they do things of note
  (join the group, graduation, publication, conferences, awards, etc), as well
  as to update project and publication information.
* When joining the group, please submit a pull request adding yourself to the
  website. You are **not** required to provide a photo and contact information
  (but you certainly may if you feel comfortable having this information public
  on the internet).

Social media:

* In general, social media can be freely used if in line with the
  [University of Liverpool Social Media Policy](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/computingservices/regulations/social-media-policy.pdf).
* Lab members are encouraged to be respectful and kind while participating if
  they are representing themselves as lab members.

## Health resources at Liverpool

**Your first priority should always be your own health, safety, and
well-being.**
No project, paper, grant or collaboration is more important than that.

In particular, time as a graduate students and as a postdoc is
[known to cause undue stress](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/anxiety-depression-mental-health-graduate-school/576769/),
resulting in consequences ranging from mild to extremely severe.

The University of Liverpool has a number of resources that may be of
assistance:

* [Student Services](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/studentsupport/): General
  information and links to the different types of support offered to university
  students.
* [Mental Health Advisory Service](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/studentsupport/mentalhealthadvisoryservice/):
  The service can help you settle into student life and offers advisory on
  mental health issues. **If you feel concerned that you or someone you know
  may have more complex mental health needs, contact the Mental Health Advisory
  Service** ([counserv@liverpool.ac.uk](mailto:counserv@liverpool.ac.uk) or
  call `0151 794 3304`).
* [Counselling Service](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/studentsupport/counselling/):
  The University offers drop-in counselling sessions. **This is not an
  emergency service. In the event of an emergency call 2222 (internal) or 999
  (external)**.
* [Self-help Information](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/studentsupport/counselling/selfhelp/):
  There is a lot of information on self-help with tips and information.
