# Code of Conduct

All members of the lab, along with visitors and collaborators, are expected to
agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed.
We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for
everybody.

> **Note:** The Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab is subject to the policies of
> the University of Liverpool. This document does not override any of those
> policies, and the policies of the University take precedence over any
> statements (implied or explicit) in this document.

## The Quick Version

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack
thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual
language and imagery is not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab
meetings, presentations, or discussions.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact [Leonardo Uieda][leo] immediately.

For official concerns or if Leonardo is the cause of your concern, please
contact the [Student Experience Team][set] and/or read the
[University of Liverpool guidelines on bullying and harassment][liv-bullying].

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event. We
expect members to treat each other professionally with respect to their work,
with constructive criticism and without dismissive behavior (e.g., eye
rolling).
