# Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab Manual

This document is designed to be a reference for lab members and collaborators
as well as part of an induction process when people join the lab. It outlines
our practices, core principals, ethics, and expectations.

**The manual is a living document:** lab members are encouraged to submit fixes
and improvements to it.

## Induction

When you first join the lab (ideally within the first few weeks), you will have
a meeting with Leo to introduce lab protocols, set expectations, add you to
communication channels, etc.

For a preview of the things we will do before, during, and after the meeting,
take a look at the [induction checklist][checklist]
