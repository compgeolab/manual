# Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab Manual

This document is designed to be a reference for lab members and collaborators
as well as part of an induction process when people join the lab. It outlines
our practices, core principals, ethics, and expectations.

**The manual is a living document:** lab members are encouraged to submit fixes
and improvements to it.
