# Lab Manual

These documents are designed to be a reference for lab members and
collaborators. It's also part of an induction process when people join the lab.
They outline our practices, core principles, ethics, and expectations.

**The manual is a living document:** lab members are encouraged to submit fixes
and improvements to it.

> ⚠️  **IMPORTANT**: The **first thing** you should do is familiarize yourself
> with the lab
> [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/compgeolab/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
> which applies to lab members and collaborators, both within and without the
> lab.
